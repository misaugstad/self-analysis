title: "Complementary stats for INST462 final project"
output: github_document

NOTE: This is not the final project; we are creating an interactive infographic in Tableau. This document is meant to house the statistical analyses that accompany that infographic.

The value we want to predict is the productivity score that I gave myself each day, on a scale of 1 to 5. This is an ordinal value, so we would like to use an ordered logistic regression instead of a multinomial regression. To use this, we first need to test the proportional odds assumption.

```{r reading.cleaning.data, echo=FALSE}
classes <- c('Date', 'numeric', replicate(9, 'logical'), 'numeric', replicate(5, 'logical'),
             'factor', replicate(7, 'logical'), 'numeric', replicate(17, 'logical'))
self.data <- na.omit(read.csv(file = "data/self_data-subset-INST462.csv", colClasses = classes))
```
