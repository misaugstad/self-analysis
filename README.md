# Self Analysis

Since August 2015, I have been collecting data about myself on a daily basis
(e.g., how much I slept, if I felt stressed that day, whether or not I
exercised). By analyzing these data, I hope to at least learn some things about
myself and get some practice analyzing data, and to at most discover ways that
my behavior can be modified to improve my quality of life. The analysis can be
easily read in this repository's self_analysis.md file,
[here](./self_analysis.md).

## Usage

Along with the code, I have uploaded the data. The code is located in
[this R markdown file](./self_analysis.Rmd). If anyone wants to play with some
data about a real world human (me), feel free to do so! Maybe you could even
help me to improve the quality of my life, wouldn't that be nice? :)

Feel free to fork/download, push new analyses or fixes, etc.
